# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project  

This is a real-time Power BI project I built by following the YouTube tutorial **“Customer Churn Analysis | Power BI + SQL + Machine Learning | Start to End Project”**.  
It helped me understand how to extract data from SQL Server, clean & model it, and build an interactive churn dashboard to identify customers most likely to leave.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview  
The dashboard provides a complete view of **customer behavior, churn trends, service usage patterns, and demographic insights**.  
It is designed to help businesses improve retention by analyzing **churn drivers, high-risk customer groups, and service performance** using filters for **tenure, geography, contract type, and internet services**.

---

## ⭐ Key Features  
- Analyze **total customers, new joiners, total churn, and churn rate**.  
- Identify churn patterns across **age groups, gender, tenure, and states**.  
- Evaluate churn based on **services used, internet type, payment method, and contract type**.  
- Visualize churn distribution across **categories such as attitude, competition, price, and dissatisfaction**.  
- Interactive filters for **monthly charge range, marital status, and service subscriptions**.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling, DAX measures, report design  
- **Power Query** – Data extraction, transformation & cleaning  
- **SQL Server (SSMS)** – Data source, table preparation & joins  
- **Python (Optional ML Add-on)** – Random Forest model for churn prediction  
- **Excel / CSV** – Additional data preparation  
- **GitHub** – Portfolio hosting & version control  

---

## 🧩 Data Model  
The dashboard is built using:  
- **Churn Data Table:** Customer demographics, services, contract details, internet info, and customer status.  
- **Joiner Data Table:** New joiners, tenure groups, service upgrades, and retention indicators.  

Both tables are cleaned using Power Query and connected via **Customer_ID** for seamless relationship modeling.

## 🚀 How to View the Report  
1. Download the `.pbix` file  
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**  
3. Ensure SQL or Excel paths are valid  
4. Explore the interactive report with slicers & KPIs

## 💡 Insights Generated  
- Churn rate observed at **27%**, driven mainly by **Fiber Optic users**.  
- **Senior customers (>50 years)** show higher churn likelihood.  
- **Month-to-month contracts** account for most churn.  
- **Payment methods** such as Credit Card show comparatively lower retention.  
- Customers with **multiple add-on services** tend to stay longer.
